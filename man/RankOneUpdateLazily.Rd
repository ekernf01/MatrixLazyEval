\title{Do a low-rank update to a matrix.}
\usage{
RankOneUpdateLazily(M, L, R)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{Any matrix with a multiplication operator defined. Usually from the Matrix package.}

\item{L, R}{Matrices with dimensions such that $$M - LR$$ works.

The update doesn't actually have to be low-rank, but if L and R are too big
you may not gain any efficiency.}
