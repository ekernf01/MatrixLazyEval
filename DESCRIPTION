Title: Lazy evaluation for cheap storage and fast operations with sparse matrices
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eric Kernfeld
Maintainer: The package maintainer <eric.kern13@gmail.com>
Description: MatrixLazyEval lets you perform operations cheaply with large sparse matrices.  
    For example, you can subtract the mean (or predictions from an OLS regression) from each 
    row or column, without explicitly storing the resulting dense matrix. Built-in functions 
    include an SVD method taking advantage of the sparsity.
